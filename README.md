# stopwatch
The stopwatch project was a simple and sleek way for me to learn about Vue, Foundation, and Sass. I really enjoyed Vue and found it to be a better alternative to Angular and React for my type of programming. I will definitely continue to play around with it in the future to see what I can craft up. Foundation on the other hand did not excite me nearly as much as either Bootstrap or Materialize. The documentation is much harder to follow, the features seem less inclusive (especially on the JavaScript side of things), and I encountered some issues with basic functionality you would expect out of a CSS framework. I had to write my own class just to center align content! I think I will prefer to use Bootstrap or Materialize over Foundation, but nevertheless it was a good time getting some experience with it. I feel like I barely scratched the surface of the possibilities of Sass. I enjoyed the simple ways it makes writing stylesheets better. I will definitely be spending more time with Sass on my upcoming projects to hone my skills with the technology.
